# who_wants_to_be_a_millionaire

In this Python project, I've developed a console-based version of the "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" game.
The program features multiple-choice questions, player interactions, and a prize system. 
The code is structured using classes to organize the game's components.
Questions: Creates the question dictionary and ensure a random questions for the game
Language: Handles the user's language preference
Player: Maintains player details.
Game: Orchestrates the gameplay.
